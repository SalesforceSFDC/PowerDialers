Dial by list is an advanced feature in FastCall that enables users to dial down a list one record after another. The user has the option to stay in a call as FastCall dials each record in succession. Or FastCall can initiate a call to the user for each outbound call to the Salesforce record. Records are dialed one at a time. When the user ends the current call, the next record is dialed. Users select records in Salesforce using a standard list view. List views can be filtered or you can use a Salesforce campaign. A custom button must be added to the page as explained
